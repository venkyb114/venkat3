Let's discuss about user management. How to create users? 

To create users manually without using tools like ansible.

useradd venky is the command used to add user with the name venky.
id venky is used to show the user.
passwd venky is the command used to set password to the user venky. 

ssh application is running automatically on the top of each linux box launched on aws. 

su - venky is the command used to swith to venky user from current user. we should know the user password if we are switching from any other user than root user. 

exit is used to come out of the current user. 

To give sudo access to one of the users: 

We need to access the file /etc/sudoers to grant access users to the one of the users. we can use vi /etc/sudoers. only root user(admin) can only access /etc/sudoers file and can grant access to any of the users.

In the sudoers file, in the last line we need to insert venky ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL, then save & exit(wq!). then the access to become the root user will be given to user venky, so he can use sudo -i.

free -m is used to check the ram.
lscpu is used to check CPU. 

man ls gives us the list of subcommands in ls command.
man su gives us the list of subcommands in su command.
